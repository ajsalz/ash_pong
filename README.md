GAME DEVELOPMENT "JUICE" DOCUMENTATION:


Total Time spent: 4.5 hours working on the game. Another 30 minutes to an hour updating my documentation, adding proper credits, and putting together the demo video to show before/after. *** Note! I forgot to mention in my demo video, but the two sound effects were part of my Alt Arcade submission (background music and chainsaw sound).


Finessing the Game:

I continued with the tutorial series I followed initially. With these I was able to add a start button, title, and a win condition text. Other elements that were fine-tuned were making the ball faster each time it hit the paddle, adding animation to the score text, and creating instances in the game manager for future flexibility. 


Customizing my UI:
Using a quick google search, I figured out how to add different text files and adding some particle effects to the ball when it collides :D
